# Building RESTful communication

It is expected that you already implemented all features described in the previous feature files. 

* [Set 1: Modelling your Vending Machine](/vending-machine-features/features-set1.md)
* [Set 2: Add behaviours and setup the Vending Machine](/vending-machine-features/features-set2.md)
* [Set 3: Handle change and sold out products](/vending-machine-features/features-set3.md)

At this point you have built the setup features for your vending machine. 
If you haven't done that yet, please go back to those features and complete them.  

## Next Steps

From now on you will evolve your vending machine enable remote communication from and to the vending machine. 

<br>You will build a separate service that will be the repository for your Products. This will be called **OnlineMarket**.

## Online Market
Online Market is a separate service you will build as part of this DOJO. 

<br>If you don't want to practice Spring Boot, consuming and/or building a Restful Service then you will not need to implement this part of the DOJO.

Your requirements will be based defined on the next [set of features](../online-market-features).
