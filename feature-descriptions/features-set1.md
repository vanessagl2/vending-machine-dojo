# 1. Accept Coins
<i>
As a vendor<br>
I want a vending machine that accepts coins<br>
So that I can collect money from the customer<br>
</i>
<br>

The vending machine will accept valid coins (nickels, dimes, and quarters) and reject invalid ones (pennies). When a valid coin is inserted the amount of the coin will be added to the current amount and the display will be updated. When there are no coins inserted, the machine displays INSERT COIN. Rejected coins are placed in the coin return.

# 2. Select Product
<i>
As a vendor<br>
I want customers to select products<br>
So that I can give them an incentive to put money in the machine<br>
</i>
<br>

There are three products: cola for $1.00, chips for $0.50, and candy for $0.65. 
When the respective button is pressed and enough money has been inserted, 
the product is dispensed and the machine displays THANK YOU. 
When the display is checked again, it will display INSERT COIN and the current amount will be set to $0.00. 
If there is not enough money inserted then the machine displays PRICE and the price of the item and subsequent checks of the display will display either INSERT COIN or the current amount as appropriate.


# 3. Return Coins
<i>
As a customer<br>
I want to have my money returned<br>
So that I can change my mind about buying stuff from the vending machine<br>

<br>

There are three products: cola for $1.00, chips for $0.50, and candy for $0.65. When the respective button is pressed and enough money has been inserted, the product is dispensed and the machine displays THANK YOU.

If there is not enough money inserted then the machine displays PRICE and the price of the item and subsequent checks of the display will display either INSERT COIN or the current amount as appropriate.
