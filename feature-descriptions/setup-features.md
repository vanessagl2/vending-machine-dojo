#Setup Money
<i>As a vendor
<br>I want to setup the current money amount
<br>So that I sell correctly
</i>
<br><br>When the vendor starts the day, the first thing they want to do is to setup the correct amount of money in the machine. That amount of money will be the base for all currency transactions in the machine. The operation for setting up the amount must be the first thing displayed on the machine when it is turned on. It is also an option that the vendor can access throughout the day. If the machine is turned down, then the amount is lost.
